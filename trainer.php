 		 	  	 <p>I’m certified in F.I.T., NASM and Crossfit Level 2.<br><br>

				I focus on using resistance training and time under tension in my training; bodyweight based exercises, resistance bands and free weights. I tend to structure on mental health and the bodies ability to aid in stress relief with a focus of reducing body fat percentage and an increase in muscle mass.<br><br>

				If someone wants to enjoy training and have an effective workout, then I’m your guy! Being creative with our bodies and always growing to be a better, stronger version is what I’ll strive to do with every client!</p><br>
